```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd depression-detection-eeg-python
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

It's a good practice to create a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can use `venv` or `conda` for this purpose.

#### Using `venv`:

### Running the Jupyter Notebook

If you want to run the Jupyter Notebook, you can start it with:

```bash
jupyter lab  # or `jupyter notebook` if you prefer
```

### Running the Scripts

```bash
python create_model.ipynb
```
